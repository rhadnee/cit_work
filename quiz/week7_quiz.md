# END OF WEEK 7 QUIZ

1. Your task is to create slightly different animals, which should have the same properties and methods, but should implement the talk() method in different ways. For example. should a cat (when talking) say "Moew", a dog "Woff", a fish "Blub" and a Cow "Muuu". They should all share the following (private) properties: name (string), age (number), food (list of strings), and have the functions get_name, set_name, get_age, set_age, get_food, add_food, remove_food. Finally, all the animals must have the talk function, but that function must, as I said, be implemented in each animal, as the animals have different sounds.

When you have made the classes, create instances of the classes and put in a list - loop through the list - and let all the animals talk! :)

2. The snail climbs up 7 feet each day and slips back 2 feet each night. 
How many days will it take the snail to get out of a well with the given depth?. Using python, write a function to solve this problem.
Sample Input: 31
Sample Output: 6

3. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number in the list.

4. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
`Hello world!`
Then, the output should be:
`UPPER CASE 1`
`LOWER CASE 9`

5. Using Object Oriented Programming, write a program that implements
a dice game. The game should have two players, and each player
should have a name and a score. The game should have a method
called `play` that takes two players as arguments and simulates
the game. The game should be played as follows:
    - Each player rolls a die.
    - The player with the highest roll wins the round.
    - The winner gets one point added to their score.
    - The game ends when one player has 5 points.
    - The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
    - The program should print out the winner's name and score.
    - If a player rolls a 6, they get an extra roll. If they roll a 6 again, they get another extra roll. If they roll a 6 a third time, they get an extra roll, but their turn ends.

6. Write a Python program that lists out all the defaults as well as custom properties of the class.

7. Write a Program in Python to implement a Stack Data Structure using Class and Objects, with push, pop, and traversal methods.

8. Using list comprehension, write a program that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of the squares of the numbers.

9. Using only functions and lists, Implement a queue data structure. The queue should have the following methods: enqueue, dequeue, and size. The queue should be "first-in-first-out" (FIFO).

10. Using a while loop, implement merge sort algorithm.
