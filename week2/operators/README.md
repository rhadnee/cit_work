# Python Operators

**What are operators in python?**

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

For example:
```python
>>> 5 + 3
8
```

Here, `+` is the operator that performs addition. `5` and `3` are the operands and `8` is the output of the operation.
