# Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

`a = 5` is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value `5` on the right to the variable a on the left.

There are various compound operators in Python like `a += 5` that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. It is equivalent to `a = a + 5`.

| Operator | Example | Equivalent to |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| =        | a = 5   | a = 5        |
| +=       | a += 5  | a = a + 5    |
| -=       | a -= 5  | a = a - 5    |
| *=       | a *= 5  | a = a * 5    |
| /=       | a /= 5  | a = a / 5    |
| %=       | a %= 5  | a = a % 5    |
| //=      | a //= 5 | a = a // 5   |
| **=      | a **= 5 | a = a ** 5   |
| &=       | a &= 5  | a = a & 5    |
| \|=       | a \|= 5  | a = a \| 5    |
